# Dashboard Image API Fix

## Problem Fixed:
The issue was that the GET endpoint `/api/v1/products/dashboard-image/` was conflicting with the existing product detail route `/api/v1/products/:id` because "dashboard-image" was being interpreted as a product ID.

## Solution:
1. **Moved dashboard routes BEFORE product routes** in the server configuration
2. **Removed trailing slash** from the GET endpoint to match your API specification
3. **Route order now ensures** dashboard-image routes are matched before the generic `:id` route

## Updated Routes:
```typescript
// Dashboard Image API routes (must be before product routes to avoid conflict)
app.get("/api/v1/products/dashboard-image", getAllDashboardImages);
app.post("/api/v1/products/dashboard-image", dashboardUpload.single('file'), createDashboardImage);

// Product API routes (after dashboard routes)
app.get("/api/v1/products", getAllProducts);
app.get("/api/v1/products/:id", getProductById); // This won't conflict now
```

## API Endpoints:
- **GET**: `http://localhost:8082/api/v1/products/dashboard-image`
- **POST**: `http://localhost:8082/api/v1/products/dashboard-image`

## Test the Fix:
```bash
# This should now work without the 422 error
curl -X GET http://localhost:8082/api/v1/products/dashboard-image
```

The route conflict has been resolved by ensuring the dashboard-image routes are registered before the generic product routes.
